    "# Project Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Related Works\n",
    "- **Prompt-Tuning** methods such as [CoOp](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01134) and [CoCoOp](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05557) are prone to overfitting on the few-shot examples available per class. While they address the problem from the prompt level i.e. language modality, they do not consider, hence leverage CLIP's shared embedding space between both vision and language modalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, **Visual Adapters** like [CLIP-Adapter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04544) tackle the problem of few-shot-learning from the visual level by learning a residual on vision features (i.e. CLS token embedding from the ViT architecture) through a bottleneck layer. However, much like prompt-tuning methods (CoOp and CoCoOp), visual adapters are also prone to overfitting on the available few-shots per class and alone, lack linguistics context provided by the textual prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyses to Motivate the Work\n",
    "To motivate the proposed method, two analyses were performed on CLIP-Adapter and CoOp after reproducing their results:\n",
    "1. The first analysis investigated if performance degradation on unseen classes was tied to distance in embedding space between the *learned* prompt (concatenatic CoOp's context tokens with the class tokens) and the *original* frozen prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/28r653Yw/clip-analysis.png\" alt=\"image_caption\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure 1: Comparison of embedding distance vs. accuracy. Drifting too far from the original prompt correlates with reduced generalization accuracy on unseen classes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Similarly, the second analysis assesses how visual features given by CLIP's frozen encoder diverged in embedding space from the learned representations by CLIP-Adapter i.e., the adapted features. The goal was to determine if high divergence would correlate with a drop in performance on unseen classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The results are shown in the figure below:\n",
    "   \n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",

    "\n",
    "*Figure 2: Empirical analysis showing that divergence in embedding space between adapted and non-adapted visual features is strongly correlated with performance degradation on novel classes*\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The issue with existing approaches is that, in base-to-novel settings, they do not perform well as they:\n",
    "1. Fail to fully exploit the shared embedding space between both vision and language modalities.\n",
    "2. Lack active regularization to prevent overfitting on base classes and keep generalization performance on novel classes compared to CLIP zero-shot performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High Level Idea\n",
    "The objective of this project is to:\n",
    "1. **Combine** the two above mentioned approaches to leverage the shared embedding space between both vision and language modalities\n",
    "2. **Constrain** the learning of context tokens (for the language side) to yield text embeddings too far from frozen CLIP embeddings\n",
    "3. **Regularize** the learning of adapted visual features to prevent them from diverging too much from frozen CLIP embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these while still managing to learn task-specific features that helps discriminate better among (seen) base classes during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "This project implements a teacher-student framework.\n",
    "- The teacher is a frozen CLIP model.\n",
    "- The student builds upon the CLIP model with both additional learnable prompt tokens  and a learnable visual adapter i.e. bottleneck head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input image $\\mathbf{x}$, a visual encoder $\\phi(\\cdot)$, a text encoder $\\psi_(\\cdot)$, a set of hand-crafted prompts $\\mathbf{P}$ and a set of learnable context tokens $\\mathbf{\\text{ctx}}$, the student is trained to simultaneusly:\n",
    "- minimize the distance between the learned, adapted visual features $(\\phi_{\\text{student}}(x) )$ and the visual features produced by frozen CLIP's visual encoder $(\\mathbf{V}_{\\text{teacher}})$ via a Kullback-Leibler divergence between the student's and teacher's logits and \n",
    "- minimize the distance between the learned, adapted text embeddings $(\\psi_{\\text{student}}([\\mathbf{\\text{ctx}}, \\mathbf{P}]))$ with CoOp's context tokens and the text embeddings produced by frozen CLIP's text encoder $(\\psi_{\\text{teacher}}(\\mathbf{P}))$ via a simple cosine similarity between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the final loss function is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{student}} = \\alpha \\mathcal{L}_{\\text {CE}} + (1-\\alpha) \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{vis}} + \\beta \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{txt}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text CE}$ is the standard **cross-entropy loss** and $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{vis}}$ is the **Visual Distillation Loss** defined as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the student's (vision) and teacher's logits defined as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{vis}} = \\text{KL}(\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{student}} || \\mathbf{p}_{\\text{teacher}})\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "where $\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{teacher}} = \\cos(\\phi_{\\text{teacher}}(x), \\psi_{\\text{teacher}}([\\mathbf{\\text{ctx}}, \\mathbf{P}]))$ and $\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{student}} = \\cos(\\phi_{\\text{student}}(x), \\psi_{\\text{student}}([\\mathbf{\\text{ctx}}, \\mathbf{P}]))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{txt}}$ is the cosine similarity between the student's embeddings produced with CoOp's context tokens and the teacher's embeddings produced without any addition to the hand-crafted prompt. Formally, it is defined as: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{txt}} = 1 - \\cos(\\psi_{\\text{student}}([\\mathbf{\\text{ctx}}, \\mathbf{P}]), \\psi_{\\text{teacher}}(\\mathbf{P}))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Although the KL loss operates on the final logits, rather than directly on the visual feature vectors, it indirectly enforces the student's visual features to be close to the teacher's by matching the output distribution structure."

For each configuration, the Base classes were randomly shuffled and split into *meta-training* (N=25) and *meta-validation*(N=26) sets.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "The combined approach effectively addressed the issues which famous prompt-tuning and adapter methods had i.e. dealing with a single modality (language and vision respectively) without leveraging cues from the other.\n",
    "From this study it was clear how important it is to avoid learning both textual and visual features that drift too far from the *CLIP Zero-Shot* ones in the shared embedding space in order to avoid catastrophic performance drops for unseen classes. This intuitively make sense as it reflects how CLIP was trained and, when disrupting such properties, without a clear signal to avoid diverging too much from original features, then the trained parameters would make the model overfit on seen classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance-wise, the implemented method yields incredible results in both base and novel performance and from the hyperparameter search analysis something interesting emerged i.e. the upper bound on *novel* classes performance remains CLIP zero-shot."

    "# Final Notes\n",
    "After developing this method, we found a paper ([KgCoOp](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13283)) which simply adds the textual loss between the learned prompt by CoOp and the hand-crafted one like the one implemented in this project i.e. $\\mathcal L_{txt}$. Their results (95.00 on base, 74.73 on novel and 83.65 HM) are inferior to those obtained with this method and the reported results are also obtained from training with 16 shots instead of 10 like in this setting. Although they achieved impressive results, their implementation is still not accounting for the *visual side* of the problem, hence yielding inferior results."
